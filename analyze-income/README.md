# Income Analysis
This Python CLI application offers data analytics and visualization using a dataset, SQLite database, and the Matplotlib library.

## Getting Started

2.  Distribution of education levels by years
3.  Gender distribution by years
4.  Distribution of education levels by gender
5.  Average per-hour income distribution by years
6.  Average per-hour income distribution by genders
7.  Average per-hour income distribution by degrees
8.  Average per-hour income distribution by years and genders
9.  Average per-hour income distribution by year and degree

When the program is run, the user receives a prompt in the console to select one of the graphics based on the provided data.
